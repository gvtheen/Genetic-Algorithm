Genetic Algorithm interface was written by C++ language, which also rely on Boost C++ library.

It has several characteristics, as follows:
(1). Use three different coding methods:  binary, real and gray coding.
(2). Selector operators contatins: roulette Wheel,random and tournament. Elitist selection was also taken into account. In order to keep the 
variety of offspringï¼Œthe maximum selection was set to 5.
(3). Fitness Scaling consists of three methods:  linear, sigma and power.
(4). Mutator operators involve in different strategies. For binary and gray coding, UNIFORM and BOUNDARY were used; for real coding, NOUNIFORM
and GAUSSIAN were considered.
(5). Cross operator also considered following methods: SINGLE, MULTIPLE, UNIFORM, ARITHMETIC and UNARITHMETIC.
